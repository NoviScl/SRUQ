# Semantic Resonance Uncertainty Quantification: Calibrating LLM Confidence through Multi-Path Reasoning

This repo implements an AI-generated research idea. The original idea can be found in Appendix Q of the paper [Can LLMs Generate Novel Research Ideas? A Large-Scale Human Study with 100+ NLP Researchers](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.04109). This serves as a demonstration of how our generated ideas could be implemented and executed as full research projects.
